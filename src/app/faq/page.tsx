    question: "What does Exousia mean?",
    answer: "Exousia is a Greek word that appears in the Bible, meaning 'authority' or 'power.' It represents the divine authority given to believers through Christ, as referenced in Luke 10:19: 'Behold, I have given you authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.'"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "What is the inspiration behind your designs?",
    answer: "Our designs are inspired by the powerful intersection of scripture and contemporary streetwear culture. We blend the dramatic visual language of anime with the poetic depth of scripture, creating pieces that serve as both fashion statements and declarations of faith. Each design undergoes a process of prayer and creative development to ensure it carries both aesthetic appeal and spiritual significance."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "How do I care for my Exousia garments?",
    answer: "We recommend washing your Exousia garments inside out in cold water and hanging to dry to preserve the print quality and fabric integrity. For detailed care instructions specific to each item, please refer to the care label on your garment or the product description on our website."
